# Sturdy 🧱
**"The app I open when I'm about to yell."**

Sturdy is a high-urgency, practical parenting tool that provides on-demand scripts for hard moments. It acts as a grounded guide—calm, firm, and practical. 

## 🎯 Core Philosophy
- **Crisis-First:** Optimized for high-stress moments. Loads fast, asks very little.
- **Literal Reflection:** We mirror the parent's exact struggle. No clinical therapy speak, no judgment, no over-explaining.
- **Age & Neurotype Adjusted:** Words automatically adapt to the child's developmental stage (2-4, 5-7, 8-12) and specific needs (ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, Sensory).
- **Actionable:** Every script follows three simple steps: Regulate, Connect, Guide.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Backend & Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions)
- **AI Engine:** Deno Edge Functions (Strict constraint prompting)
- **Subscriptions:** RevenueCat (Apple/Google In-App Purchases)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/mobile`: The pure Expo application (UI, State, RevenueCat).
- `/supabase`: The backend Brain (Edge Functions, DB Migrations).
